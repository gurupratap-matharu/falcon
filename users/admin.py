Referencing the User model

If you reference User directly (for example, by referring to it in a foreign key), your code will not work in projects where the AUTH_USER_MODEL setting has been changed to a different user model.

get_user_model()
Instead of referring to User directly, you should reference the user model using django.contrib.auth.get_user_model().
This method will return the currently active user model â€“ the custom user model if one is specified, or User otherwise.

When you define a foreign key or many-to-many relations to the user model, you should specify the custom model using the AUTH_USER_MODEL setting.
